# December 5, 2011

New data types and updated data:

* Added support for RNA-Seq expression data (COADREAD, KIRC, LUSC).
* Added support for log2 copy-number data (available on the Plots tab).

# November 15, 2011

Another major update, with the following new features and data:

* New and improved mutation details, with sorting and filtering capabilities.
* Survival analysis - assess survival differences between altered and non-altered patient sets.
* Links to the [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) to view copy-number alterations.
* All data updated to the October 2011 TCGA Broad Firehose run.
* RPPA data is now available for 2154 samples in six tumor types.
* Many new and updated MAF files - now 9 tumor types with mutation data.

# September 12, 2011

This is a major update, which includes the following main changes:

* New tumor types and data: Now ~3500 samples from 12 tumor types, including mutation data for 8 tumor types.
* RPPA data support - the Portal currently has data for ovarian and breast cancer.
* Access control via [OpenID](http://openid.net/).
* The code for the cBio Portal has now been fully open sourced, and made available at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/cbio-cancer-genomics-portal/).  If you would like to join our open source efforts and make the portal even better, drop us an email.

# April 26, 2011

This is the initial release of the cBio TCGA Cancer Genomics Portal. The portal contains data from all completed and ongoing TCGA projects. All data is automatically imported from the output of the Broad Firehose.

This release includes data on 2531 samples from 11 tumor types.
