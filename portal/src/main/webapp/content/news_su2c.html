<ul>
<li>New studies added: Breast cancer sequencing studies from the Broad and the Sanger, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and cervical cancer TCGA.</li>
<li>All data updated to the <strong>Broad Firehose</strong> run from July 25, 2012.</li>
<li><strong>COSMIC data</strong> added to Mutation Details (via Oncotator)</li>
<li>All predicted functional impact scores are updated to <strong>Mutation Assessor 2.0</strong></li>
<li>Users can now base queries on genes in recurrent regions of copy-number alteration (from <strong>GISTIC</strong> via Firehose).</li>
<li>The <a href="onco_query_lang_desc.jsp">Onco Query Language (OQL)</a> now supports queries for specific mutations or mutation types.</li>
<li><strong>Drug information</strong> added to the network view (via Drugbank).</li>
<li>Extended <strong>cross-cancer</strong> functionality, enabling users to query across all cancer studies in our database.</li>
<li>Users can now base queries on frequently mutated genes (from <strong>MutSig</strong> via Firehose).</li>
<li>New <strong>"build a case"</strong> functionality, enabling users to generate custom case sets, based on one or more clinical attributes.</li>
<li>New OncoPrint features, including more <strong>compact OncoPrints</strong>, and support for <strong>RPPA</strong> visualization.</li>
<li>New feature: <strong>Mutation Diagrams</strong> that show mutations in the context of protein domains.

<h1 id="january-27-2011">January 27, 2011</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updated TCGA data sets</strong> for Breast Cancer, Ovarian, and Uterine Corpus Endometrioid Carcinoma.</li>
<li>New <strong>gene symbol validation</strong> service.  You can now use gene aliases and/or Entrez Gene IDs within your gene sets.</li>
<li>New and <strong>improved mutation details</strong>, with sorting and filtering capabilities.</li>
<li>In collaboration with Bilkent University, we have added a <strong>new Network tab</strong> to our results pages.  The network tab enables users to visualize, analyze and filter cancer genomic data in the context of pathways and interaction networks derived from <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org">Pathway Commons</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Updated data for breast and endometrial cancer from TCGA, including 499 fully sequenced breast cancer samples.</li>
<li>You can now query across different cancer studies (feature available directly from the home page).</li>
<li>The code for the cBio Portal has now been fully open sourced, and made available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cbio-cancer-genomics-portal/">Google Code</a>.  If you would like to join our open source efforts and make the portal even better, drop us an email.</li>
