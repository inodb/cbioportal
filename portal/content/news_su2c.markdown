* __Updated TCGA data sets__ for Breast Cancer, Ovarian, and Uterine Corpus Endometrioid Carcinoma.
* New __gene symbol validation__ service.  You can now use gene aliases and/or Entrez Gene IDs within your gene sets.
* New and __improved mutation details__, with sorting and filtering capabilities.
* In collaboration with Bilkent University, we have added a __new Network tab__ to our results pages.  The network tab enables users to visualize, analyze and filter cancer genomic data in the context of pathways and interaction networks derived from [Pathway Commons](http://www.pathwaycommons.org).

* Updated data for breast and endometrial cancer from TCGA, including 499 fully sequenced breast cancer samples.
* You can now query across different cancer studies (feature available directly from the home page).
* The code for the cBio Portal has now been fully open sourced, and made available at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/cbio-cancer-genomics-portal/).  If you would like to join our open source efforts and make the portal even better, drop us an email.
