<h1 id="december-5-2011">December 5, 2011</h1>
<p>New data types and updated data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for RNA-Seq expression data (COADREAD, KIRC, LUSC).</li>
<li>Added support for log2 copy-number data (available on the Plots tab).</li>

<h1 id="november-15-2011">November 15, 2011</h1>
<p>Another major update, with the following new features and data:</p>
<ul>
<li>In collaboration with Bilkent University, we have added a new <em>network</em> tab to our results pages.  The network tab enables users to visualize, analyze and filter cancer genomic data in the context of pathways and interaction networks derived from <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org">Pathway Commons</a>.</li>
<li>New and improved mutation details, with sorting and filtering capabilities.</li>
<li>Survival analysis - assess survival differences between altered and non-altered patient sets.</li>
<li>Links to the <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)</a> to view copy-number alterations.</li>
<li>All data updated to the October 2011 TCGA Broad Firehose run.</li>
<li>RPPA data is now available for 2154 samples in six tumor types.</li>
<li>Many new and updated MAF files - now 9 tumor types with mutation data.</li>
</ul>
