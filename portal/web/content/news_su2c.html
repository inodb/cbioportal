<ul>
<li><strong>Updated TCGA data sets</strong> for Breast Cancer, Ovarian, and Uterine Corpus Endometrioid Carcinoma.</li>
<li>New <strong>gene symbol validation</strong> service.  You can now use gene aliases and/or Entrez Gene IDs within your gene sets.</li>
<li>New and <strong>improved mutation details</strong>, with sorting and filtering capabilities.</li>
<li>In collaboration with Bilkent University, we have added a <strong>new Network tab</strong> to our results pages.  The network tab enables users to visualize, analyze and filter cancer genomic data in the context of pathways and interaction networks derived from <a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org">Pathway Commons</a>.</li>
